  englishText: 'About inputs:

    When the player just moves around normally, the
    inputs of the player are usually not needed directly in order to create functionality
    in your world. However, in some cases, such as when controlling a vehicle, the
    inputs of the player is needed in order to create custom functionality.


    Inplementation:

    There
    are 2 ways of reading input data in VRChat: Either by using the GetAxis commands
    in code or by listening to the input events.


    Due to the different controllers
    available, it is sometimes nessesarry to check what controllers are connected
    in order to create custom input systems.


    The following examples list the
    different inptus available and what their current values are.'
