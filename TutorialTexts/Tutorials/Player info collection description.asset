  englishText: "About player information:\r\nOnce you have a reference to a player,
    you can access a whole bunch of information. In this example, the currently selected
    player from the script before is used.\r\nNote: The bone position and rotation
    data is also available, but shown in a different script.\r\n\r\nLocal and synced
    information:\r\nBe aware that only some information is synced. Items held, locomotion
    settings and tracking data is only available on the local player. If you try
    to access those on another player, the script will crash.\r"
