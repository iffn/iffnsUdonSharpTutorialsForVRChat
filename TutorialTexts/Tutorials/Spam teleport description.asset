  englishText: 'About Spam Teleporting:

    Teleporting the player every frame can
    be useful if you want to take control over the players movement without using
    a station.


    Smoothing out the lag:

    While the standard teleport function
    looks smooth locally, it will look like stuttering for other players since the
    new position will only arrive every once in a while. Therefore, there is an option
    to make the transition smooth by using lerpOnRemote as true.

    Note that this
    is using the same lerp function as is used to move the platform in this example.


    About
    SpawnOrientation:

    This is about how the teleportation affects people using
    roomscale VR.

    When using AlignPlayerWithSpawnPoint, the player origin will
    be used and the player can no longer walk around freely.

    When using AlignRoomWithSpawnPoint,
    the room center point will be used and the player can still move a bit by walking
    in their room.


    Limitations:

    - As with the teleporter before, the VRChat
    main menu is static relative to the World space and will not follow the player.

    -
    Due to the sync delay between players, there is always a delay between the player
    and the platform for remote players. This has been addressed by using the NUMovement
    by Nestorboy to teleport the player and the NUMovementPlatformSyncModForVRChat
    by iffn to sync the player using stations.'
