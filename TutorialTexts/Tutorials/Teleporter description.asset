  englishText: "About teleportation:\r\nTeleporting a player can be useful in many
    instances, such as simple door or ladder implementations, by using a teleporter
    spell or to respawn a player. \r\n\r\nWhat happens:\r\nWhen teleporting a player,
    their avatar gets assigned a new position and rotation. In this example, the
    target location is taken from a transform on top of the circle.\r\nIf you don't
    want the player to rotate, just take the existing rotation of the player as an
    input and the value will stay the same. The same can also be done for the position,
    if you just want to rotate the player.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nThe standard Teleport
    behavior works well, if they are not called all the time. If you want to call
    it every frame to control the players movement, check out the next part.\r\nAlso,
    note that the main menu of VRChat is located in World space and will not move
    with the player when teleporting.\r"
