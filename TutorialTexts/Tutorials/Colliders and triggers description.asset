  englishText: 'About the players capsule collider:

    The player in VRChat actually
    controls the movement of an invisible capsule, which for example stops them from
    moving through walls or falling through the ground. This capsule collider has
    a height of 1.65m and a diameter of 0.4m.



    About detecting collisions:

    There
    are 3 types of collisions with the player which can be detected: Colliders, Triggers
    and Particles. For each, there is a Enter, Stay and Exit fuction which you can
    define and which is called by VRChat.

    - Trigger functions run when the players
    collision capsule overlaps with a collider where the Is Trigger flag is set to
    True.

    - Collider functions run when the players collision capsule overlaps
    with a physics object where the collider where the Trigger flag is set to False.
    As seen in the example, this neither works when the player walks into a stationary
    object nor when the player is squeezed by a objets that moves without physics.

    -
    The same works for particle emitter when correctly set up. This is not demonstrated
    here.
