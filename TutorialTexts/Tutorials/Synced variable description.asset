  englishText: "About continuous synchronization:\r\nIt makes sense to synchronize
    some variables continuously. However, the data is usually only received a few
    times per second. So far less often than the framerate. There are different ways
    of handling the time in between.\r\n- The default behavior is using the UdonSyncMode
    None. This only updates the variable to the latest known state. This means the
    variable will jump once data is received.\r\n- The linear behavior increases
    the value linearly. This makes the change more smoothly but still very predictable\r\n-
    The smooth behaviour increases the value smoothly. This can however make the
    value overshoot sometimes.\r\n\r\nAbout this implementation:\r\nThe owner makes
    the sphere lerp between random points. The position of the sphere is then sent
    out to the other players as different variables, each with their own sync behavior.
    The difference between the behaviors is visible for everyone who isn't the owner.\r"
