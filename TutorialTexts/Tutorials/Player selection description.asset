  englishText: "About player selection:\r\nSome of the following scripts show how
    to get information from players. Therefore, a player selection is useful. This
    script is one possible way of implementing such a system.\r\n\r\nOnPlayerJoined
    and OnPlayerLeft:\r\nUpdating the player list every frame does not make sense.
    Luckily, the functions OnPlayerJoined() and OnPlayerLeft() are called automatically
    by VRChat each time a player joins or leaves. You can define these functions
    for each script.\r\n\r\nAbout UI buttons calling functions:\r\nIt is sometimes
    useful to run a function whenever a button is clicked. However, at the moment,
    Udon and U# do not seem to support the direct change of these functions at runtime.
    Therefore, the function needs to be linked in the editor. Adding a custom script
    to each button meanwhile allows the implementation of dynamic functionalities.
