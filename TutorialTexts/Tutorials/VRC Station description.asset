  englishText: 'Stations in VRChat:

    Stations are essentially seats. They can
    be used both as static seats inside your house for example or vehicle seats which
    tie the player to a moving object.


    Implementation

    Stations can be
    implemented in VRChat without a special script by simply adding the VRCStation
    component to an object and assigning the Ender and Exit locations. However, once
    you have attached your own script that calls the OnStationEntered() and OnStationExited()
    functions, you need to also add the Interact() function to make it work.


    Issues
    with current stations:

    When testing the default stations in VRChat, some
    problems will become apparent.

    - When a player sits on a station, the height
    reference used is down at the feet. Since people use many different avatar sizes,
    the default behavior means that larger avatars will seem to float while smaller
    avatars will be buried inside the chair. This can be adjusted by manually moving
    the station so that the hip position or head position is at a desired height.
    AAChair by Kamishiro Industry is an example of a working implementation.

    -
    Stations usually apply the sitting animation to the avatars. This does not apply
    to people who use full body tracking however. Since these players often use playspace
    movers, it makes sense to add a toggle to the colliders and stations of seats,
    so that people can disable them.'
