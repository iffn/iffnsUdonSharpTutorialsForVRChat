  englishText: 'About GetPlayers()

    Your script might need to know who is currently
    in the Lobby. The function GetPlayers() can therefore help you. However, it needs
    to be implemented correctly in order to work properly.


    How it works:

    The
    GetPlayers() function writes the current players into an existing array. Therefore,
    the array first needs to be created. The length of the array should at least
    be as long as the current player count. This can be gotten with VRCPlayerApi.GetPlayerCount().


    Note:

    If
    the array is longer than the current player count, the function GetPlayers()
    will only change the first few values.

    So, if the array has a size of 10
    and there are only 3 players in the lobby, only the first 3 elements will be
    changed. If 1 leaves and the array is updated, only the first 2 will be changed
    and the 3rd will remain. This can potentially leave a reference to  a player
    who has already left, which can cause errors.'
