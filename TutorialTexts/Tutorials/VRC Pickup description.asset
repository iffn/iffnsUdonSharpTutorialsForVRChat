  englishText: 'A VRC Pickup is a predefined component that allows players to pick
    up items. There are various variables and functions which can be accessed using
    Udon Sharp. For the functions to work correctly, the script needs to be attached
    to the same object as the VRC Pickup component.


    To sync the pickup, you
    can directly use the VRC Object Sync component. Alternatively, you can try to
    write your own sync behavior. Note that it is not possible to have a manual sync
    component on the same object as the VRC Object Sync.
