  englishText: "Basics about Interact():\r\nA common way to trigger a script in VRChat
    is to use the Interact() function. It is attached to a collider, which is highlighted
    and a text appears when the players hand or cursor is close enough to interact.\r\n\r\nDetailed
    mechanics:\r\nEach click by the player runs the script once. Clicking and holding
    only runs the script once at the beginning. The release is not detected as far
    as I'm aware.\r\n\r\nAbout the example:\r\nClicking on the cube toggles the sphere
    on and off. Since the script does not forward information to other players, the
    change is purely local.\r"
