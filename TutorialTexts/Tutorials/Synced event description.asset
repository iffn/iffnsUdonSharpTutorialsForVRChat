  englishText: "About Events:\r\nAnother way of sharing information is to use Events.
    This essentially means that you can tell other people to run a public function
    on the object. This is useful for events that should happen for current players
    but do not matter for late joiners.\r\n\r\nAbout this implementation:\r\nIn this
    example, the sphere jumps up a bit when clicking on the button. Since late joiners
    do not need to know if the sphere has jumped before, an Event is appropriate
    for this implementation.\r\n\r\nAbout implementing the SendCustomNetworkEvent
    function:\r\nThe SendCustomNetworkEvent function needs the name of the function
    that should be called as a string. While it is possible to enter \"YourFuncitonName\"
    directly as a string, it will make your code less easy to maintain, since spelling
    errors and name changes can break your code without Visual Studio warning you.
    Therefore, the use of nameof() is highly recommended. \r\nAlso, note that:\r\n-
    The function being called needs to be public\r\n- The function being called is
    not allowed to receive any arguments. So nothing inside the () brackets.\r"
