  m_Name: Linear grab controller description
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  englishText: "Being able to grab and move something feels intuitive and immersive,
    especially in VR. Since a nice implementation is quite difficult to do, it makes
    sense to have a reusable template. This can be used for simple objects like drawers
    as well as slider controllers.\r\n\r\nThe following script uses a VRCPickup,
    which can be picked up. The local offset in the local Z direction is used to
    calculate the new position. At the end of each frame, the pickup is moved back
    to its original local location, hiding the actual position of the pickup in the
    player\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\nDifferent settings allow the adjustment of offset,
    symmetry and snap range. For other players as well as external controllers, the
    output value can be used which, depending on the symmetry setting is either between
    0\u20261 or -1\u20261.\r\n\nNote: This script uses the the smooth manual sync
    script also shown here in order to optimize the network performance."
