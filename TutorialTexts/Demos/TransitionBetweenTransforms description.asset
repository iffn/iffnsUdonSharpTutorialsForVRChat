  englishText: "About transitions:\r\nSometimes, objects should transition between
    different states when activated. This can be for a door or an elevator for example.
    The following script therefore provides a generic implementation, where a Transform
    will transition in terms of Position, Rotation and Scale between the original
    location and the Target Transform. This transition is synced between players
    and available to late joiners.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThis has been implemented
    as a state machine. The synced state is a boolean called atStart, while the local
    states also include the 2 transition states. Since U# currently does not support
    Enums yet, the local states are implemented as integers.\r\n\r\nUse:\r\n3 things
    are needed: An Activator object, a MovingTransform that should move and a Target
    Transform that represents the second state. Attach the script to the Activator
    and assign the Moving and Target Transforms. It ais also possible to adjust the
    transition time as needed.\r"
