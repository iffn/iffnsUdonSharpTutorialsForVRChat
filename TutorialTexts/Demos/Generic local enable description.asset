  englishText: 'About local object activation:

    It often makes sense to allow
    the player to enable and disable certain parts of the world locally such as mirrors,
    chairs and objects that eat a lot of performance. It therefore makes sense to
    create a generic script that can be reused.


    Implementation:

    The implementation
    has 2 arrays, to which objects can be assigned to in the editor. Interacting
    with the attached object will enable the EnableObjects and disable the DisableObjects.
    If the DisableWhenClickingAgain flag is set to true, the button acts like a toggle
    for the EnableObjects. For this, the current state of the first EnableObject
    is used.
