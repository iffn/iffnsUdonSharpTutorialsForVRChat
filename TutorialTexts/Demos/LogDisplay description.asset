  englishText: "Being able to see the current state of a script is very useful during
    development. But the creation of string output strings can take up a lot of resources.
    It also does not make sense to fill up already complex programs with debug code.
    Therefore, a reusable and optimized solution would be very useful. \r\n\r\nCurrently,
    the stable version of UdonSharp does not support a lot of elements needed to
    write generic code such as class inheritance, interfaces, or static types. Therefore,
    alternative ways need to be found.\r\n\r\nThe solution is therefore to have one
    common debug state behavior, which can be implemented by both the behaviors under
    development and the preferred output method. Since it does not make sense to
    collect the state every frame or when the player is far away, the common debug
    behavior is able to indicate, when the output information should be collected.
    Since this check is a lot quicker than generating the output, a performance improvement
    is achieved.\r"
