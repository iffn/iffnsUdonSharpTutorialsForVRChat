  englishText: "Welcome to my UdonSharp tutorial world\r\n\r\nThis world is designed
    to show you what you can do with U# in VRChat and how to implement it.\r\n\r\nThere
    are already a large amount of Tutorials and other resources available for Unity
    and C# and you should use them. This world therefore mostly focuses specific
    U# functions.\r\n\r\nI have originally learned UdonSharp while making this world.
    Therefore, not everything might be perfect\r"
